Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, known for its simplicity and versatility. Whether you’re new to programming or looking to expand your skills, Python is a great place to start.

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It emphasizes readability and simplicity, making it ideal for beginners. Python is used in web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.

## Installing Python

Most systems come with Python pre-installed. To check, open your terminal and type:

```bash
python --version
```

If not installed, visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version for your operating system.

## Writing Your First Python Program

Create a file called `hello.py` and add:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Run it in your terminal:

```bash
python hello.py
```

## Python Basics

### Variables

Variables store data:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
```

### Data Types

Common types include:

- `int` (integer): `x = 10`
- `float` (decimal): `y = 3.14`
- `str` (string): `text = "Hello"`
- `bool` (boolean): `is_active = True`

### Lists

Lists store multiple items:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

### Control Flow

#### If Statements

```python
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")
```

#### Loops

```python
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### Functions

Functions organize code:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

## Next Steps

Explore Python’s standard library, try small projects, and practice regularly. Python’s community is large and welcoming, so don’t hesitate to seek help or resources online.
